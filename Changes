Revision history for Perl extension Net::SSLeay.

0.01  Thu Jun 27 03:56:00 1996
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.16
0.02  Trial with SSL.pm name
0.03  Renamed everything Net::SSLeay
0.04  19.7.1996 Fixed some 0.6.1 incompatibilities, namely removed
      #include <ssl_locl.h>, fixed typo in SSL_get_cerificate, fixed
      the return type of the same. --Sampo
1.00  19.6.1998, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@iki.fi>
	- overhauled to SSLeay-0.9.0
	- renamed cat to sslcat
	- added lots of convenience functions, like get_https
	- added couple of X509 routeines
	- improved tests and documentation
	- fixed callbacks (but found that old callbacks dont work)
1.01  23.6.1998, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@iki.fi>
	- made Makefile.PL check SSLeay version and to be more CPAN kosher
	- changed build instructions to build outside perl source tree
	- added random number initialization using /dev/urandom (if available)
	- made ssl_write_all accept references, this is more memory efficient
1.02  8.7.1998, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@iki.fi>
	- Added SSL_(CTX)?_set_options and associated constants
	- Slight clean-ups
1.03  4.1.1999, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@iki.fi>
	- Merged URI encoding patch to make_form
	  from Joe Rhett <jrhett@navigist.com>
	- changed sslcat, ssl_read_all, ssl_write_all to return error messages
	  as second member of list. Functions continue to behave the old way
	  if scalar return value is used (they check this with wantarray).
	  Change was suggested by Joe Rhett.
	- changed $trace levels so that 0 does not produce any output
	- changed get_https and put_https to fake error 900 in $response
	  return field
	- changed print_errs and some other internals to return textual
	  errors instead of error count
	- changed SSLeay.xs comments from #if 0 to #define REM. This will
	  hopefully make it easier to compile with some vendor compilers
	- Added version detection code for OpenSSL-0.9.1c and checked
	  build
