Revision history for Perl extension Net::SSLeay.

??????
    Fixed some typos. Patched by Neil Bowers.
    SSLeay.pm convenience functions now call Net::SSLeay::initialize that
    initializes the SSL library at most once. Added requirement for
    multi-threaded apps that use get_https and similar SSLeay convenience functions to
    call Net::SSLeay::initialize before threading starts. This is due to the
    fact that the SSL initilization functions are non-reentrant.
    Patch from kmx to protect SSLeay_add_ssl_algorithms from multiple loads
    and reentrancy in multi-threaded perls.
    Patch from kmx to add reentrancy protection for callbacks in
    multithreading.
    Updated ppport.h, fixed some complaints from ppport.h

    - added couple more X509_STORE_CTX family functions
1.04  31.1.1999, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@_iki._fi>
    - Backward incompatible changes in OpenSSL API mean that 1.04 will
      drop support for SSLeay and all OpenSSL versions prior
      to 0.9.2b release. Thanks guys!
    - Detected errors in OpenSSL-0.9.2b/ssl/ssl.h - see patch in README
    - Reordered arguments of several functions to track OpenSSL-0.9.2b
      changes. This also changes the order of args in corresponding
      perl functions. You have been warned!
        - SSL_use_certificate_ASN1(s,d,len)  // swapped d and len
    - WARNING: Possibly fatal verify_callback parameter list issue
      is still standing
    - cleaned up many macros that used to access ctx->session directly,
      OpenSSL-0.9.2b defines thes macros properly so I use them now.
    - Added SSL_ctrl() and SSL_CTX_ctrl()
    - Added SSL_get_options(), SSL_CTX_get_options(),
      SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list()
    - Removed SSL_add_session(), SSL_remove_session(),
          and SSL_flush_sessions() per #if 0 in ssl.h, line 667
    - Updated paths in various utility programs
    - Upgraded version number detection logic in Makefile.PL

    30.7.1999, final squeeze to get this out --Sampo
    - upgrade to OpenSSL-0.9.3a
    - upper case all header names so keys of the hash returned
      from get_https are predictible
    - fixed get_https and post_https so they don't do shutdown
      anymore. This used to cause headaches when connection
      renegotiation happened.
    - applied ssl_read_CRLF patch by Clinton Wong <clintdw@@netcom._com>
    - ActivePerl diffs from anton@@_genua.de applied,
      but not tested.

    - Merged URI encoding patch to make_form
      from Joe Rhett <jrhett@@navigist._com>
    - changed sslcat, ssl_read_all, ssl_write_all to return error messages
      as second member of list. Functions continue to behave the old way
      if scalar return value is used (they check this with wantarray).
      Change was suggested by Joe Rhett.
    - changed $trace levels so that 0 does not produce any output
    - changed get_https and put_https to fake error 900 in $response
      return field
    - changed print_errs and some other internals to return textual
      errors instead of error count
    - changed SSLeay.xs comments from #if 0 to #define REM. This will
      hopefully make it easier to compile with some vendor compilers
    - Added version detection code for OpenSSL-0.9.1c and checked
      build
1.02  8.7.1998, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@iki._fi>
    - Added SSL_(CTX)?_set_options and associated constants
    - Slight clean-ups
1.01  23.6.1998, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@iki_.fi>
    - made Makefile.PL check SSLeay version and to be more CPAN kosher
    - changed build instructions to build outside perl source tree
    - added random number initialization using /dev/urandom (if available)
    - made ssl_write_all accept references, this is more memory efficient
1.00  19.6.1998, Sampo Kellomaki <sampo@@_iki.fi>
    - overhauled to SSLeay-0.9.0
    - renamed cat to sslcat
    - added lots of convenience functions, like get_https
    - added couple of X509 routines
    - improved tests and documentation
    - fixed callbacks (but found that old callbacks dont work)
0.04  19.7.1996 Fixed some 0.6.1 incompatibilities, namely removed
      #include <ssl_locl.h>, fixed typo in SSL_get_cerificate, fixed
      the return type of the same. --Sampo
0.03  Renamed everything Net::SSLeay
0.02  Trial with SSL.pm name
0.01  Thu Jun 27 03:56:00 1996
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.16
